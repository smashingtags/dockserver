Autoscan integrates with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr and Google Drive to fetch changes in near real-time without relying on the file system. Wait, what happened to Plex Autoscan ? Well, Autoscan is a rewrite of the original Plex Autoscan written in the Go language. In addition, this rewrite introduces a more modular approach and should be easy to extend in the future. Introduction \u00b6 Autoscan is split into three distinct modules: Triggers Processor Targets Let's take a look at the journey of the path /tv/Westworld/Season 1/s01e01.mkv coming from Sonarr. Sonarr's path is translated to a path local to Autoscan. \\ /mnt/unionfs/Media/TV/Westworld/Season 1/s01e01.mkv The path is accessed by Autoscan to check whether it exists and adds it to the datastore. Autoscan's path is translated to a path local to Plex. \\ /data/TV/Season 1/s01e01.mkv This should be all that's needed to get you going. Good luck! Triggers \u00b6 Triggers are the 'input' of Autoscan. They translate incoming data into a common data format called the Scan. Autoscan supports two kinds of triggers: Daemon processes. These triggers run in the background and fetch resources based on a cron schedule or in real-time. \\ Bugs may still exist. Webhooks. These triggers expose HTTP handlers which can be added to the trigger's software. Each trigger consists of at least: A unique identifier: think of Drive IDs and HTTP routes. \\ Webhooks use /triggers/ + their name to uniquely identify themselves. Trigger-wide priority: higher priorities are processed sooner. \\ Defaults to 0. RegExp-based rewriting rules: translate a path given by the trigger to a path on the local file system. \\ If the paths are identical between the trigger and the local file system, then the rewrite field should be ignored. Daemons \u00b6 Daemons run in the background and continuously fetch new changes based on a cron expression . The following daemons are currently provided by Autoscan: Google Drive (Bernard) Inotify Webhooks \u00b6 Webhooks, also known as HTTPTriggers internally, process HTTP requests on their exposed endpoints. They should be tailor-made for the software they plan to support. Each instance of a webhook exposes a route which is added to Autoscan's main router. If one wants to configure a HTTPTrigger with multiple distinct configurations, then these configurations MUST provide a field called Name which uniquely identifies the trigger. The name field is then used to create the route: /triggers/:name . The following webhooks are currently provided by Autoscan: Sonarr Radarr Lidarr Manual Webhook \u00b6 Autoscan also supports a manual webhook for custom scripts or for software which is not supported by Autoscan directly. The manual endpoint is available at /triggers/manual . The manual endpoint accepts one or multiple directory paths as input and should be given one or multiple dir query parameters. Just like the other webhooks, the manual webhook is protected with basic authentication if the auth option is set in the config file of the user. URL template: POST /triggers/manual?dir=$path1&dir=$path2 The following curl command sends a request to Autoscan to scan the directories /test/one and /test/two : curl --request POST \\ --url 'http://localhost:3030/triggers/manual?dir=%2Ftest%2Fone&dir=%2Ftest%2Ftwo' \\ --header 'Authorization: Basic aGVsbG8gdGhlcmU6Z2VuZXJhbCBrZW5vYmk=' Note: You can visit /triggers/manual within a browser to manually submit requests Configuration \u00b6 A snippet of the config.yml file showcasing what is possible.

Optional: set username and password. Experimental support for more events \u00b6 Autoscan also supports the following events in the latest versions of Radarr and Sonarr: Rename On Movie Delete and On Series Delete On Movie File Delete and On Episode File Delete We are not 100% sure whether these three events cover all the possible file system interactions. So for now, please do keep using Bernard or the Inotify trigger to fetch all scans. Processor \u00b6 Triggers pass the Scans they receive to the processor. The processor then saves the Scans to its datastore. The processor uses SQLite as its datastore, feel free to hack around! In a separate process, the processor selects Scans from the datastore. It will always group files belonging to the same folder together and it waits until all the files in that folder are older than the minimum-age , which defaults to 10 minutes. When all files are older than the minimum age, then the processor will call all the configured targets in parallel to request a folder scan. Anchor files \u00b6 To prevent the processor from calling targets when a remote mount is offline, you can define a list of so called anchor files . These anchor files do not have any special properties and often have no content. However, they can be used to check whether a file exists on the file system. If the file does not exist and you have not made any changes to the file, then it is certain that the remote mount must be offline or the software is having problems. When an anchor file is unavailable, the processor will halt its operations until the file is back online. We suggest you to use different anchor file names if you merge multiple remote mounts together with a tool such as UnionFS or MergerFS . Each remote mount MUST have its own anchor file and its own name for that anchor file. In addition, make sure to define the 'merged' path to the file and not the remote mount path. This helps check whether the union-software is working correctly as well. Minimum age \u00b6 Autoscan does not check whether scan requests received by triggers exist on the file system. Therefore, to make sure a file exists before it reaches the targets, you should set a minimum age. The minimum age delays the scan from being send to the targets after it has been added to the queue by a trigger. The default minimum age is set at 10 minutes to prevent common synchronisation issues. Customising the processor \u00b6 The processor allows you to set the minimum age of a Scan. In addition, you can also define a list of anchor files. A snippet of the config.yml file: # override the minimum age to 30 minutes: minimum-age : 30m # override the delay between processed scans: # defaults to 5 seconds scan-delay : 15s # override the interval scan stats are displayed: # defaults to 1 hour / 0s to disable scan-stats : 1m # set multiple anchor files anchors : - /mnt/unionfs/drive1.anchor - /mnt/unionfs/drive2.anchor The minimum-age , scan-delay and scan-stats fields should be given a string in the following format: 1s if the min-age should be set at 1 second. 5m if the min-age should be set at 5 minutes. 1m30s if the min-age should be set at 1 minute and 30 seconds. 1h if the min-age should be set at 1 hour. Please do not forget the s , m or h suffix, otherwise the time unit defaults to nanoseconds. Scan stats will print the following information at a configured interval: Scans processed Scans remaining Targets \u00b6 While collecting Scans is fun and all, they need to have a final destination. Targets are these final destinations and are given Scans from the processor, one batch at a time. Autoscan currently supports the following targets: Plex Emby Jellyfin Autoscan Plex \u00b6 Autoscan replaces Plex's default behaviour of updating the Plex library automatically. Therefore, it is advised to turn off Plex's Update my library automatically feature. You can setup one or multiple Plex targets in the config: targets : plex : - url : https://plex.domain.tld # URL of your Plex server token : XXXX # Plex API Token rewrite : - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local file system to : /data/ # path accessible by the Plex docker container (if applicable) There are a couple of things to take note of in the config: URL.

You can setup one or multiple Emby targets in the config: targets : emby : - url : https://emby.domain.tld # URL of your Emby server token : XXXX # Emby API Token rewrite : - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local file system to : /data/ # path accessible by the Emby docker container (if applicable) URL.

Put your spare hardware to use with Tdarr Nodes for Windows, Linux (including Linux arm) and macOS. Code in this repository is for Tdarr V1, Tdarr V2 is not open-source. Designed to work alongside applications like Sonarr/Radarr and built with the aim of modularisation, parallelisation and scalability, each library you add has its own transcode settings, filters and schedule. Workers can be fired up and closed down as necessary, and are split into 4 types - Transcode CPU/GPU and Health Check CPU/GPU. Worker limits can be managed by the scheduler as well as manually. For a desktop application with similar functionality please see HBBatchBeast .

This should make things easier for those who are not as comfortable in the commandline or just prefer a ui. I have also removed a couple of the config elements, namely, the PLEXPATH and MOUNTEDPATH options. These are now handled directly by the application and Docker. When you pass through you plex media directory, the app will automatically map this and find your plex path to make the config easier. Now as long as the container has write access to the media directory, it should make enabling the backup posters much easier. There is an option to automatically migrate your old config files into the new ui for easier migration. New HDR banners along with a script to migrate from the old banners to the new ones should you wish to use them. You can stick with the old banners if you would like. The new scripts us TheMoviedb for finidng posters and metadata, so for maximum compatability and fewer issues, these work best when using TheMoviedb as your metadata agent. Throughout my testing, it is only sequals that were giving me issues, as the Plex scanner will name your films like: Boss Baby 2: Family Business Whereas on TheMoviedb it is named: Boss Baby: Family Business This means that the search for the film can fail in the script. New Features: \u00b6 GUI for managing the application in a browser Add 4k mini banners to your 4K TV episodes. New HDR banner design Dolby Vision HDR Banner HDR10 Banner Migration scripts for moving from the old config files to the new database and for moving from the old HDR banner to the new designs. Features \u00b6 4K/HDR Posters \u00b6 This script will go through your library and add a 4k banner to your posters. Configurable options include: Selecting full width banners or mini corner banners enabling HDR banners Backup your original posters alongside your media This can be run on both your films library and your TV shows Library. If enabled on your TV shows, a mini 4K banner will be added to each of your 4K epiisodes, not the season posters. This is due to the possibility of having Shows/Seasons with mixed resolutions. TV shows will be done at the same time as film posters. 3D Posters \u00b6 Much like the 4K poster script, this will go through your films and add a 3D banner to your films. Currently as Plex has no support for labelling content as 3D this will only work for 3D films kept in a separate library. You can configure the script to have full width banners or the mini corner banners as well as backing up your posters. Available Banners \u00b6 The 4K/3D banners will be combined with the HDR posters if they are enabled. \u00b6 Hide 4K \u00b6 For those of you who don't separate your 4K and non-4K content into separate libraries. This script will go through your films library and add an \"Untranscodable\" tag to any of your films that only have a single 4K copy of the film available. By adding this tag to your users restrictions, they simply won't see these 4K films giving your hardware a break. If your hardware is powerful enough, there is the option to create an optimized version so that your users can play this version. This will send your film to be optimized with the Plex optimize feature baked directly into Plex. This means all the hardwork is done by your plex server, (useful if you're hosting these scripts on a lower powered device.) Once the transcode has finished, the untranscodable tag will be removed the next time the script runs and your users will be able to see the film. Disney Collection \u00b6 Where this whole project started. A simple script, that will go through your films library and add any film from the Disney Studio into a Disney collection. Pixar Collection \u00b6 As above only with Pixar Films Requirements \u00b6 A Plex Media Server How to Install \u00b6 Install Plex-Utills from Docksever Mediamanager Menu.

It acts as a companion of reverse proxies like nginx, Traefik or HAProxy to let them know whether queries should pass through. Unauthenticated users are redirected to Authelia Sign-in portal instead. Features summary \u00b6 Here is the list of the main available features: Several second factor methods: Security Key (U2F) with Yubikey . Time-based One-Time password with Google Authenticator . Mobile Push Notifications with Duo . Password reset with identity verification using email confirmation. Single-factor only authentication method available. Access restriction after too many authentication attempts. Fine-grained access control per subdomain, user, resource and network. Support of basic authentication for endpoints protected by single factor. Beta support for OpenID Connect . Highly available using a remote database and Redis as a highly available KV store. Compatible with Kubernetes ingress-nginx controller out of the box. For more details about the features, follow Features . If you want to know more about the roadmap, follow Roadmap .

This is to avoid data-loss and to harden your backups for your final dockserver migration. This guide will take you through a migration with Teamdrive deployed on your pg installation. Feel free to experiement with the gdsa builder in the CLI. Prerequisites: \u00b6 PGblitz Tdrive/Tcrypt mount deployed CloudCMD deployed (Under Community Apps) Open CloudCMD, Navigate to: /appdata/plexguide/.blitzkeys Download the contents of that folder (rclone.conf and GDSA keys) to your local machine. These files are very important. Handle with care. On some forks of PG these files are placed under /uploader and /mount. Now you are ready to backup your PG apps. sudo wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dockserver/dockserver/master/backup.sh | sudo bash This will create a folder named /appbackups on the root of your remote drive. When the backup is done, check that these files exist on your remote drive. Also, check them for file sizes to make sure it looks right. Plex can take a long time, be patient. Now, please order a VPS with ubuntu 18/20 on it and follow the instructions on the frontpage . When dockserver is installed on your host, return here and follow instructions Mount & Uploader \u00b6 Install CloudCMD (under addons) Navigate to /opt/appdata/system/rclone Upload the rclone.conf from your old server Navigate to /opt/appdata/system/servicekeys Upload the rclone.conf to this folder Rename rclone.conf to rclonegdsa.conf Navigate to /opt/appdata/system/servicekeys/keys Upload all service keys (GDSA01,02..) Rename all service keys to not containing a 0 so GDSA01 becomes GDSA1 and so forth.. Open a terminal Create the folders sudo mkdir -p /opt/appdata/system/{rclone,servicekeys} sudo chown -cR 1000:1000 /opt/appdata Edit your rclone.conf sudo nano /opt/appdata/system/rclone/rclone.conf Remove all GDSA lines here, only the remotes(g/tdrive, g/tcrypt) are left in the file - PGUNION has to be deleted as well CTRX+X press y Edit the rclone.conf to rclonegdsa.conf sudo nano /opt/appdata/system/servicekeys/rclonegdsa.conf Again, remove all zeroes so that the values will be displayed like this: [GDSA1] service_account_file = /system/servicekeys/keys/GDSA1 [GDSA2] service_account_file = /system/servicekeys/keys/GDSA2 CTRL+X y Done.
